            <h2>Artefact 1: SPLASH/ICFP Conference - Student Volunteer Participation</h2>
            
            <h3>Brief Description/Summary</h3>
            <p> Attended and served as a student volunteer at the SPLASH (Systems, Programming, Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity) and ICFP (International Conference on Functional Programming) conference held in Singapore. This academic conference is one of the top conferences for programming languages research.</p>

            <h3>My Contribution and Engagement</h3>
            <p>Performed session monitoring duties, ensuring smooth operation of technical presentations and workshops throughout the conference. While ensuring to do my volunteer responsibilities, I actively participated in conference content by attending talks, talking with domain experts who cannot be found in Singapore on topics such as garbage collector implementation, and built connections with fellow students and early-career researchers entering the programming languages field.</p>

            <h3>How This Experience Will Be Used</h3>
            <p>This conference experience is foundational to my aspiration of pursuing research in programming languages. I managed to get exposure to latest research, understanding problems that are currently of interest in the field. I also managed to make connections with others in the research community which helps create a network of potential collaborators for interesting projects I could participate in.</p>

            <h2>Outlook</h2>
            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Navigating Unfamiliar Academic Territory:</strong> Entering a space filled with established researchers and advanced technical content was initially intimidating. I embraced the learning opportunity rather than being discouraged by knowledge gaps, asked questions which may have made me feel stupid but actually allowed me to learn.</p>

            <h3>Learning and Growth</h3>
            <p>This conference experience marked a significant step in developing my identity as an aspiring programming languages researcher. I managed to gain exposure to concepts which were not really pursued in my research group like continuation-passing style which broadened my understanding of the topics in programming languages.</p>

            <h2>Outlook - ANU Logic Summer School</h2>
            
            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
            <p><strong>Managing Breadth and Depth:</strong> The summer school covered an enormous range of topics, from foundational metalogic to specialized advanced topics. I addressed this by focusing Week 1 on building strong foundations and being more selective in Week 2 understanding that I'm not going to be able to understand everything and focus on understanding the content that's more relevant for me.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Connecting Theory to Work:</strong> I addressed this by actively asking instructors about connections I saw with what I was doing and seeing whether they were actual connections or a misunderstanding of what's taught.</p>

            <h3>Learning and Growth</h3>
            <p>This summer school significantly strengthened my foundation in logic. The theoretical grounding in computability and incompleteness deepens my understanding of fundamental limitations and possibilities in programming language design.</p>
            
            <p>Exposure to modal type theories and proof engineering opened new research directions, particularly around using advanced type systems for program verification.</p>
